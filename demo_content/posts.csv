<h2>6. Apprise for New Products &amp; Deals</h2>
<p>eCommerce companies update their website with new products from time-to-time, but they fail to register enough demands for the newly launched produces primarily because they did not inform their customers/potential buyers through appropriate channels.</p>
<p>To inform your customers about the latest developments on your E-shop, you can do the following:</p>

Mobile Apps to Bookmark Webpage and Read it Later,LIVE,"For bookmarking and offline reading, you only have two serious options: Pocket and Instapaper. In this article we&#8217;ll do head-to-head comparison between  Pocket and Instapaper.
",easy,0,"<p>When you are at work or while surfing internet, you may come across some cool stuffs; a piece of interesting news or an article you want to read. Or perhaps you get an email from a friend recommending you to read an interesting article. You would like to bookmark the link to read on your free time rather than distracted from current activity.</p>
<p>Traditionally, people used browser for bookmarking links and access the links from desktop or mobile browsers. All modern browsers including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera support this feature. Those strategies still work, but they aren’t pretty. You require internet access to open the bookmarked link and the list is not not so well organized. New in the era of mobile you deserve better.</p>
<p>For bookmarking and offline reading, you only have two serious options: Pocket and Instapaper. In this article we’ll outline the similarities between two services and compare them, head-to-head to see features exclusive to each of them.</p>
<h2>Pocket</h2>
<p><a href=""http://stacktips.com"" target=""_self""><img alt=""pocket-read-it-later-app"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12132"" height=""355"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"" src=""/media/uploads/articles/52/pocket-read-it-later-app-620x355.jpg"" srcset="""" width=""620""/></a></p>
<p>Formerly called as “Read It Later” and in 2012 it was renamed to Pocket. Pocket allows you to bookmark content from desktop browser, mobile apps or even directly from popular third party apps (selected apps only). Once the link is saved, it automatically syncs to your phone, tablet, or computer so you can view it at any time, even without an Internet connection. Once you finished reading, you can archive the article to remove it from your main list or mark star to add it to your Favorites.</p>
<p>The saved links in Pocket are organized in a list. You can also customize the list display to an grid view or search content by keyword. Pocket’s customizable tags feature gives you granular control over how your content is organized.</p>
<p>Article full view mode is optimized for distraction-free reading. It stripe out the advertisements, sidebar or any other extra website widgets, so you focus only on the content. You can adjust the reading mode that best suit to your eye by changing the background color, font style, size or night mode.</p>
<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pocket’s mobile app are available to download for free on your iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows, Blackberry and Amazon devices.</li>
<li>Standalone desktop apps are available for Windows and Mac.</li>
<li>Browser extensions are available for Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pricing – Freemium</h3>
<p>Pocket’s basic service is free to use, but it also offers premium plan which comes for $4.99 a month or with a discounted price of $44.99 if you buy an yearly subscription.</p>
<p>The Pocket premium unlocks the additional features such as permanent library, advance full-text search, tag suggestions, advance customization for improved reading experience and sponsored ad free experience.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel the free version of Pocket is good enough as long as you’re not bothered to see some sponsored post from Pocket. With free version, you can still take advantage of the same core features.</p>
<h2>Instapaper</h2>
<p><a href=""http://stacktips.com"" target=""_self""><img alt=""instapaper-read-it-later-app"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12133"" height=""349"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"" src=""/media/uploads/articles/52/instapaper-read-it-later-app-620x349.jpg"" srcset="""" width=""620""/></a></p>
<p>Instapaper is yet another service that allows you to discover, bookmark, and experience interesting web content. This is one of the most popular service and gives a stiff competition to Pocket.</p>
<p>Instapaper allows you to save articles, videos, and other pages and sync them to across web and mobile devices. Like Pocket, Instapaper allows you to save links directly from mobile apps, using browser extension or even directly from third party apps (selected apps only).</p>
<p>You can organize articles in folders and move to archive when you’re finished reading. The article details view allows you to adjust font size, style and background colors including night reading mode. On mobile devices you can take advantages of Text-to-Speech, so you can just listen.</p>
<h3>Pricing – FREE</h3>
<p>Instapaper is acquired by Pinterest in August 2016. And the good news is, after the acquisition, in November 2016 the company declared making Instapaper Premium available to all Instapaper users, free of charge.</p>
<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Instapaper Android, iPhone, iPad and Kindle apps are available to download for free from respective app stores.</li>
<li>The official desktop browser extensions are available only for Chrome and Safari. Although there are no official Firefox extensions available, there are couple of unofficial ones that serves the purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pocket &amp; Instapaper Head-to-Head</h2>
<p>Both Pocket and Instapaper have the same basic feature to bookmark, sync and makes the content available to read them anywhere, with or without an Internet connection. Even so, Pocket and Instapaper differ pretty dramatically. Here are a few of the features that are exclusive to each service:</p>
<div class=""fancy-list"">
<h3>Pocket</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uses tagging system to organize articles</li>
<li>Built-in social network and allows quick direct sharing with other Pocket users.</li>
<li>Instant import of URLs from your clipboard in the mobile apps</li>
<li>Desktop app for Mac and Windows user</li>
<li>Free and premium service for $4.99 month.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class=""fancy-list"">
<h3>Instapaper</h3>
<ul>
<li>Articles are organized into folders</li>
<li>Allow your to follow other users and see their recommended articles</li>
<li>Text highlighting and In-line article commenting</li>
<li>Tons of sorting options to find articles quickly</li>
<li>Free</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Final Verdict</h2>
<p>Overall, as an individual and as a blogger, am using Pocket premium for quite some time and I am very happy about this. This is helping me to save the best of the web and read during commute. Specially in London underground lines.</p>
<p>Instapaper simple and equally powerful service. And now that it is free, I think in recent months I will switch back from Pocket.</p>

7 Tips for Mobile App Project Management,LIVE,"It&#8217;s safe to say that mobile app development is just as complex a process as any other IT&hellip;
",easy,0,"<p><span class=""drop-cap"">I</span>t’s safe to say that mobile app development is just as complex a process as any other IT project. That’s why strategies used in projects aimed at developing mobile apps are to a large extent similar to those used by managers in other fields. Here are practical tips for making sure you pass the 7 following steps of app development smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<h3>1. Define your objectives</h3>
<p>Every project requires a vision – your role as manger is to define it and communicate it to your team. It’s important that you have a deep understanding of your objectives – only then will you be able to organize and manage the project to match specified requirements. Once you set key details, you’ll be able to start developing your project timeline and establish a provisional budget.</p>
<h3>2. Make a plan</h3>
<p>As a manger, you’ll be the one responsible for the execution of the project. Create a thorough plan and stick to it. Assign roles to developers on the basis of their expertise. Your overall plan should suggest your chosen devices, interaction points, number of screens, typical usage patterns and many other characteristics of your mobile app.</p>
<h3>3. Go visual</h3>
<p>Before you set out to the development process itself, it’s important to know what you’re aiming for. That’s the moment for the UI experts to step in and design the visual style of your app. They’ll make sure that your app offers an engaging user experience and incorporates intuitive call-to-action items to help the app make profit.</p>
<p>Expect a selection of storyboards and mockups to make it your way. They’ll give you an idea about an interface design together with screen wire frames to show you how the app will look like and function.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><small>Photo credit : ewelinawoloszyn[dot]com</small></p>
<h2>4. The development phase</h2>
<p>This is the key moment in making your app come to life – all the features and functions modeled in previous stages will now become real. Keep tabs on the work of developers as they launch into iterative coding sessions and choose the best algorithms to ensure the app’s great performance. It’s a good idea to have a general developer overlooking the process and reporting directly to you – he’ll make sure that the coding is clean, robust and efficient.</p>
<p><a href=""http://stacktips.com"" target=""_self""><img alt=""The development phase"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8972"" height=""248"" loading=""lazy"" src=""/media/uploads/articles/198/The-development-phase.png"" srcset="""" width=""618""/></a></p>
<h3>5. Testing</h3>
<p>Once the app is ready, it’s time to test it. Even if it takes additional time on your schedule, don’t complain about it. Testing is that crucial moment when the app is ran on various devices, browsers and platforms to check whether it works smoothly, doesn’t contain any glitches and looks just like you planned.</p>
<h3>6. Deploying the app</h3>
<p>Once you’re done testing your app, you’re ready to deploy it. Choose your marketplace carefully – perhaps you’ll need to redefine your marketing strategy once the app is ready and running. Remember that there are many options for deployment apart from iTunes or Google Play store.</p>
<h3>7. Don’t forget about maintenance</h3>
<p>Once the app is out there and gaining popularity, make sure not to lose sight of it. Read reviews carefully and see whether users point to particular features of the app that negatively impact their experience.</p>
<p>After the first round of user testing, you’ll be able to make valuable corrections and release the app once more in a new version. That’s something your marketing team will appreciate as well, as they can build momentum until the very launch of the updated app and leverage the interest for their purposes.</p>
<p>Project management for building mobile apps is much clearer if you approach it in this step by step manner. Follow tips included above and you’ll be on your way to developing great apps in effective time frames.</p>

8 Surefire Tips For Your Mobile App Success,LIVE,"Be it Java or any other platform, Android or other OS’s,mobile app development is everywhere and a popular&hellip;
",easy,0,"<p>Be it Java or any other platform, Android or other OS’s,mobile app development is everywhere and a popular revenue source for developers. Yet, only a fraction of them taste success. Whether it’s an app for commercial use or an enterprise rollout,the goal of any app is to get user acceptance and adoption.Irrespective of the platform, there are a few basic pointers that are common. With that in mind, we’ve put together some tips to make your app concept as fool proof as possible because it is just too easy to go unnoticed.</p>
<h2>Get Your ResearchHatOn!</h2>
<p>You think your app idea is awesome. It could truly be, yet, double-checking the app storeand a simple Google search will save you a lot of time (and money). Knowing what’s out there only helps refine and avoid pitfalls or failure.</p>
<p>From our experience, the “research phase” of your app plan should be your first priority. You should conduct thorough research of the mobile app landscape, in particular, looking to seeif your app idea is unique or not. Also, if your idea already has been developed and is in the market. If it does exist, don’t be discouraged. This may actually be a positive. Look at existing apps and see how your idea could build features that help your app stand apart. At times, a few little enhancements or integrations can do wonders and rocket your app to unexpected levels. The bottom line: Research, research, research!</p>
<h2>Take The Platform Quiz Early</h2>
<p>This is probably the easiest one: Which platform should you develop on? Well, there are only two platforms to compare – Apple &amp; Android. Currently, there are more Android phones being sold than Apple. But, stats aren’t everything. For your app, think about the user type/the market and then what device that user is most likely to use. Align your solution with respect to the potential device; meaning to target one device at one given point of time. Once it clicks, you could proceed on to the other platform better prepared and more confidence.</p>
<h2>Make Sure Your App AddsValue</h2>
<p>By now you should have an idea of why your app is unique/how it helps and adds value to users. It’s no secret that the app market is thriving, owing to the thousands of available apps, hence it is imperative to offer something extra (a.k.a add value to the users). One of the best ways is to reward the users each time they use your app – it could be anything, such as offering discounts for in –app purchase oroffering more informative content, special offers and so on.</p>
<h2>Have A Great App Design</h2>
<p>First impressions are extremely important for apps – in order for your app to succeed, it has to look/feel great. The look and the feel of your app is going to influence adoption of your app and if will be successful. Make sure the images, graphics and the pictures are high resolution and the color definitions are crystal clear irrespective of the OS and the device.</p>
<h2>Make Sure The FunctionalityIs Pretty Perfect</h2>
<p>If a user downloads your app, it should work. Period. It should work effortlessly across devices. Make sure yourigorously test all the functionalities, ensuring that everything works perfectly on all possible devices. Leave no functionality untested, as one error may lead to another and a slight delay or malfunction makes the app crash.</p>
<h2>Make Sure It’s User Friendly</h2>
<p>Never forget: Appsaremade for the user and haveto beeasy/intuitiveto use.Keep the interface grounded and simple as not all users willbe tech-savvy or have the patience to explore your app. No clutter, no distortion, no irrelevant content, no delays or unnecessary add-ons for your app.</p>
<h2>Give The User APart To Play</h2>
<p>Yes, personalization is loved by all! It is undoubtedly the clear winner. If your app can do that, you’ll get user adoption much quicker.The personalization touches don’t have to be big ones. The personalization can be in the form of changing colors, backgrounds and much more. But remember to draw the line at the right user-levels and abilities – you don’t want users to have too much control of the app. Too much control can be overwhelming and, well, bad to maintain control.</p>
<h2>Cater To The New Age Audience</h2>
<p>Keeping up with the user’s pace of adapting to technology may seem tough, yet it definitely is an essential in order to remain relevant. Deliver off-line capabilities to lend resourcefulness and reliability and your user will keep coming back to you. Non-dependence from network connectivity is a huge liberation.</p>
<p>This is an age of social networking, if your app can help connect your user to the social networks, that’s great. This is a boon as integrating on social networks increases app-sharing and increases visibility to amazing levels.</p>
<p>These are just a few tips and with the app industry still growing, the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Happy App-ing!</p>

<p>The interviewer will likely go through your CV and ask questions about interesting technologies that you have used.  A friend recently remarked to me how much they loved asking about technologies they didn’t know about to see if the candidate could explain it to them.  A lot of CV’s nowadays simply list every technology a person has ever touched.  Avoid this; if you’ve got it written down then expect to be called out on it.  Candidates who say “I only tried it for a couple of days” after listing it on their CV will lose credibility.</p>
<p>Make sure you’ve prepared a good answer for questions about Spring and Hibernate. These are two of the most popular technologies in Java but they are often poorly understood.</p>
<h1>3. Find somewhere private</h1>
<p>Have a location ready in advance of being called. Whether it’s a room at work or somewhere at home, don’t be rushing around to find somewhere when the interviewer calls. You want to be prepared and relaxed so you can do your best- get yourself in the zone!   It also gives a terrible first impression if you first words to your potential new boss are “can you just give me a minute whilst I find a room?”.  You instantly paint yourself as badly organised.  Not a great start.</p>
<h1>4.  Pre-prepare list of questions</h1>
<p>At the end of the interview there is always a slot to ask questions about the new role and company.  This is still part of the interview and you will be judged based on what questions you’ve asked. This is a great opportunity to impress; by asking about the development style you can enthuse about the way your new team works.  Perhaps they do Agile or TDD. If this is the case then use the opportunity to effuse about your experience in those areas, or if you don’t have the experience then you can talk about how keen you are to learn these new things.  Showing you’re eager and interested in the role is a big plus point and can absolutely swing an average interview into your favor.   That doesn’t apply for just the end of the interview.  Sound enthusiastic throughout the interview, make it clear how excited you are about the role.  Many candidates don’t do this and it’s an easy way to stand out from the crowd.  It is likely your interviewer is doing several interviews in a row, so if you can do just one thing to stand out you will greatly increase your chances of progressing to the next round.</p>
<h1>5.  Say “I don’t know”</h1>
<p>This might sound crazy but it really isn’t.  When an interviewer asks you a question then it is likely they know the answer. If you don’t, and you try to guess your way through it then it will be incredibly obvious.  It’s absolutely fine to say that you don’t know something.  It’s an easy way to earn respect too.  You can also add “but I’m happy to happy a guess if you’d like?”.  This way it’s clear you’re not lying about your knowledge but you have the opportunity to show off your analytical skills.  If possible though, try not to say you don’t know more than a couple of times an interview.</p>
<p>Hopefully with these tips you’ll be well on your way to your dream job.  Learning core java is very important (and javatechig is full of great posts to help you) but there’s a lot more to it than memorizing answers.</p>",uploads/articles/243/thumbnail.png,1,,article,standard,"tech,blog"

                <p id=""f71dae99-f2b7-46a3-b914-81b352a673f5"" class="""">
                    My personal journey in tech blogging has been a roller coaster ride. I have been blogging ever since I entered the IT industry as a new entrant in 2008. It was driven by the passion for learning new technology and exploring stuff that is contrary to my regular day-to-day job.
                </p>
                <p id=""d8c3b8c7-5586-418a-811f-0262ea169c72"" class="""">
                    So when I was working as an Android application developer, in my personal time I was trying to learn J2EE and Apache Struts. And, I love taking notes along the way while doing small and simple POCs.
                </p>
                <p id=""252a56ed-1130-4668-8188-d497d5aaa856"" class="""">
                    At that time there was no application like Notion, so I decided to create a website using Google Blogspot and started capturing all my notes there. Those notes mainly served as a bookmark, so I could refresh my memory whenever I wanted.
                </p>
                <p id=""f9d8d71d-daf7-46b7-a3b5-eb3db9fa4614"" class="""">
                    Slowly, I started to like writing detailed tutorials and sharing my knowledge which some of my friends, and colleagues loved to read.

                <p id=""8f452e9a-4ef1-4ad4-b232-53d735f1a17e"" class="""">And that is how I was introduced to blogging.</p>

                    But, I never wanted to be a full-time blogger. I never believed I had that spark, which would make me living out of it. That made me a passive blogger.

                    1. Content is the King, but Consistency is the Key to Success!

                    Great content is essential for any successful blog, this is a must-have. However, consistency is equally important. You need to strike the right balance between quality and quantity.

                    As a lone worrier, I used to dedicate a few hours over a weekend to produce 2/3 articles for my blog.  But I never realized that we need to be consistent in publishing stories.  I used to publish 3/4 articles in a day and then nothing for the rest of the month.

                    Publishing many articles a day, makes your readers overwhelmed with content so it is very unlikely that all your stories will be read by everyone. But publishing a story on a regular interval, let’s say every Sunday, will definitely drive more engagement, and your readers will love to spend a few minutes reading a story per week.
